<meta name="description" content="It is, once again, time for me to scratch that domain-registration itch. I often feel that I’m not a real nerd without a web site and my own domain, even though I rarely do anything interesting them. I don’t think I’ve put any effort into a site since the days of Tripod and Geocities. Back then the web was a new frontier for me and I found joy in learning new things about markup and scripting. My exploration of PHP and Perl to create dynamic web content was what put me on my career path. One would think that this would have created some lasting personal connection to the web, but one would be wrong; for me it’s mostly business and little pleasure. Sometimes there are things I feel like writing down and possibly sharing, but (as odd as it may seem) social media feels a bit too impersonal for me. It wasn’t very long ago that the web was a place of discovery. People that had something to say or share were forced to build their own digital homes, and finding that content was a fun challenge. Communities formed around sharing links to sites of interest and promoting each other’s content. Nowadays a massive share of the web’s consumable information is aggregated into a handful of goliath services that spoonfeed access to users over always-on mobile devices. It’s the future I dreamed of as a teenager, but living in it feels very different. So now I’m going back to basics! Hopefully you find something interesting here. If you don’t, then at least I’ve done you the favor of posting in a way that won’t pollute your feeds. :grin:" />

<p>I often feel that I’m not a real nerd without a web site and my own domain, even though I rarely do anything interesting them. I don’t think I’ve put any effort into a site since the days of Tripod and Geocities. Back then the web was a new frontier for me and I found joy in learning new things about markup and scripting. My exploration of PHP and Perl to create dynamic web content was what put me on my career path. One would think that this would have created some lasting personal connection to the web, but one would be <em>wrong</em>; for me it’s mostly business and little pleasure.</p>

<p>Sometimes there are things I feel like writing down and possibly sharing, but (as odd as it may seem) social media feels a bit too impersonal for me. It wasn’t very long ago that the web was a place of discovery. People that had something to say or share were forced to build their own digital homes, and finding that content was a fun challenge.
