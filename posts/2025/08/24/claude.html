        <p>I've seen a lot of amazing technology over the course of my lifetime and have been in awe before, but never like this. The experience of using Claude Code makes me feel like we've finally arrived in the future. This is some crazy sci-fi black magic and I am completely in love.</p>
<p>For the uninitiated, Claude Code is an AI programming assistant that essentially embeds itself within a coding project. It learns the codebase, examines the documentation, and builds itself a context that helps to maximize its utility. It lets you interact with your code in natural language. Some people may bristle at that idea since more abstraction means less understanding of what's happening under the hood. That's a fair argument, and AI tools can certainly be used naively and unsafely, but I'd like to put that focus on the magic.</p>
<p>My relationship with code has changed a lot over the past 30 years. The process of putting an idea on a computer screen has always thrilled me, since the time of staying up late writing MadLibs programs in QBasic with my friends. I've been writing code professionally for nearly two decades and, for much of that, coding was my happy place. When it started to become less fun, I found myself at a loss. I'd still find pockets of joy here and there, but burnout set in pretty hard. Writing code felt like a slog. Keeping up with the latest tools was a constant challenge. Customer requirements shift, forcing you to drop hours of effort into the bin. It felt like busy work that was <em>in the way</em> of my getting to a solution that I could already envision.</p>
<p>Now I understand that my frustration came from the gap in time between conceptualizing a solution and implementing it. By conceptualizing, I don't mean simply listing requirements; I mean really thinking about what a complete solution would entail. Once I understand how to solve a problem and how all the components should fit together, the code is simply a barrier between me and the solution. I know what I need to do, I've learned the things I need to learn, but still need to devote the time to writing everything. Maybe this is my ADHD talking and you can't relate, but it has led to no end of frustration as I've wrestled with this idea that an activity I've loved for so long could be the source of unhappiness.</p>
<p>Claude has shattered that conceptual barrier for me. It isn't just a coding tool - it's an idea engine. Software engineering is about solving problems, and accelerating the time to a solution is a <em>Good Thing</em>. The rapid iteration that Claude Code provides lets me focus on my ideas.</p>
