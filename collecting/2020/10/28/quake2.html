I turned my attention to Google to see if I could find an archive of old content from Polycount or Planet Quake. I ended up finding a great collection on tastyspleen.net that held the players and maps I was looking for and a ton more. It also introduced me to the Q2Pro client and server. My mission changed from a simple recovery operation to a deployment. So now quake2.ninjabot.me is a thing. Right now it’s cycling through a collection of deathmatch maps. I plan to add more mods at a later date if there are enough players. I’m also working on adding stat-tracking and possibly bots for team games with low player counts. More to come as I have time, but for now go play some Q2!" />

<p>Still rolling around in a giant pile of nostalgia I decided to dig through files on a pile of old hard drives I had lying around. My chief goal was to find my old Quake 2 installation so I could recover my former collection of player models, skins, maps, and game mods. I ultimately failed in that mission; the drive I was sure held my quarry was <em>super</em> dead.</p>

<p>I turned my attention to Google to see if I could find an archive of old content from Polycount or Planet Quake. I ended up finding a great collection on <a href="http://tastyspleen.net/">tastyspleen.net</a> that held the players and maps I was looking for and a ton more. It also introduced me to the Q2Pro client and server. My mission changed from a simple recovery operation to a deployment.</p>

<p>So now <strong>quake2.ninjabot.me</strong> is a thing. Right now it’s cycling through a collection of deathmatch maps. I plan to add more mods at a later date if there are enough players. I’m also working on adding stat-tracking and possibly bots for team games with low player counts. More to come as I have time, but for now go play some Q2!</p>
